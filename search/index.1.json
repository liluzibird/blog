[{"Albert Huynh":[],"categories":[],"content":"\u0026quot;Mirror Pond [Explore]\u0026quot; by mclcbooks is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nWould I be better off on a microblog site like Mastadon? This blog site is a bit more complicated than I thought. I mean some of you guys out there have probably made a website before, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit\u0026hellip;messy. Y\u0026rsquo;all think it\u0026rsquo;s easy to make all these sections? Bro, I spent the whole day figuring out how to properly make sections and nice little dropdown sidebar stuff for my docs. I mean it is kind of fun I guess, lots of control and customization. Sucks a ton of my time and nobody reads it other than me though.\nWell, since the last post I did, I\u0026rsquo;ve pretty much done what I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted. Everything I\u0026rsquo;ve done, and going to do in the future, pretty much boils down to everything being in either news or docs. For now, I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep going in this direction. Don\u0026rsquo;t really know how much longer I can regularly post when the semester is going to get started right around the corner, but I\u0026rsquo;ll do it anyway.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s pretty much all the updates from me. Thank you to whoever is reading this or most likely, some bot scanning this post.\n","date":"January 5, 2024","img":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/news/2024/01/second-thoughts/featured.png","lang":"en","langName":"English","largeImg":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/news/2024/01/second-thoughts/featured_hu451a6902d3a1068cdcb789becb0c90f4_1176614_500x0_resize_box_3.png","permalink":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/news/2024/01/second-thoughts/","series":[],"smallImg":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/news/2024/01/second-thoughts/featured_hu451a6902d3a1068cdcb789becb0c90f4_1176614_180x0_resize_box_3.png","tags":[],"timestamp":1704514808,"title":"Second Thoughts?"},{"Albert Huynh":[],"categories":[{"title":"Linux","url":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/categories/linux/"}],"content":"For some reason turning on your monitors in Linux is a bit funky, so you might need to type a few commands in the terminal for monitors to power off.

I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have done it without the help of Razon Yang, the wonderful developer of the Hugo Bootstrap theme. He has helped me out a ton with this blog site (I\u0026rsquo;ll be sure to clear the cache before I call you up). Well\u0026hellip; I already took a week to figure out more git commands (I will never fully master all these confusing instructions), reading both Hugo docs and Razon\u0026rsquo;s docs and trying to get GitHub pages to update my changes. However, I do plan on improving the website some more.\nNow, it may be surprising to some of you guys out there, but I actually have friends. Some of these friends might even go on this website and read these words as we speak. These friends, I message them quite often and frankly, I think they are getting annoyed of me sending them messages so damn often. With the creation of this blog site, I plan on bothering them even more. Send them more memes from Lemmy and posts about how Big Tech is coming after you and everybody is stealing your information, how you should convert to FOSS and use Linux instead.\nFuture plans Even though I\u0026rsquo;ve slaved many days on just getting this site up and running, I still plan on adding more features to it.\nGiscus widget for comments Uploading my documentations for projects I\u0026rsquo;ve done Make some categories for personal life, gaming, school, rant, and whatnot Whatever the heck pops into my mind Stay tuned for more updates\u0026hellip;\n","date":"January 3, 2024","img":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/news/2024/01/first-post/featured-sample.webp","lang":"en","langName":"English","largeImg":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/news/2024/01/first-post/featured-sample_huc6bcc14d597e300fd9ab4aae536c68a5_498412_500x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp","permalink":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/news/2024/01/first-post/","series":[],"smallImg":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/news/2024/01/first-post/featured-sample_huc6bcc14d597e300fd9ab4aae536c68a5_498412_180x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp","tags":[],"timestamp":1704329423,"title":"First Post"},{"Albert Huynh":[],"categories":[],"content":"Docs for whatever I\u0026rsquo;m doing.\n","date":"September 6, 2022","img":"","lang":"en","langName":"English","largeImg":"","permalink":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/docs/introduction/","series":[{"title":"Docs","url":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/series/docs/"}],"smallImg":"","tags":[],"timestamp":1662475343,"title":"Introduction"},{"Albert Huynh":[],"categories":[],"content":"See also README.md.\n","date":"April 17, 2022","img":"","lang":"en","langName":"English","largeImg":"","permalink":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/blog/2022/04/readme/","series":[],"smallImg":"","tags":[{"title":"README","url":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/tags/readme/"}],"timestamp":1650184529,"title":"README"},{"Albert Huynh":[],"categories":[],"content":"Hope you enjoy the site.\n","date":"January 1, 1","img":"","lang":"en","langName":"English","largeImg":"","permalink":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/about/","series":[],"smallImg":"","tags":[],"timestamp":-62135596800,"title":"About"},{"Albert Huynh":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":"January 1, 1","img":"","lang":"en","langName":"English","largeImg":"","permalink":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/contact/","series":[],"smallImg":"","tags":[],"timestamp":-62135596800,"title":"Contact Me"},{"Albert Huynh":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":"January 1, 1","img":"","lang":"en","langName":"English","largeImg":"","permalink":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/offline/","series":[],"smallImg":"","tags":[],"timestamp":-62135596800,"title":"Offline"}]
