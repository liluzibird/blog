[{"Albert Huynh":[],"categories":[],"content":"Image stolen from Adam Michael Wood\nBasic font emphasis styles First of all, I think markdown is pretty good if you want to do basic stuff like italics, bold, strikeout, underli\u0026ndash;. Oh what?? Markdown doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a syntax for underline you say? Well what am I to do now. Oh maybe because markdown supports HTML5, I can use tags. What now? That doesn\u0026rsquo;t work either because this site can\u0026rsquo;t do it for some inexplicable reason even though it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to?\nImage captions Don\u0026rsquo;t even get me started on making image captions. Check my last post for evidence of this. I was trying to give credit to the sources where I found my gif and decided to write a bit more. Well, turns out Markdown doesn\u0026rsquo;t exactly have a caption thing for images. Instead, you can either italicize and make it look like it\u0026rsquo;s properly formatted right underneath the photo, or you can make a little table. Well because this site is using a featured photo and I\u0026rsquo;m not displaying the image using ![](image.png), I can\u0026rsquo;t exactly use\n| ![](image.png) | |:--:| | *Space* | Soooo I did the table thing but without linking the image directory, making it just the table title. That made my entire sentence bold. Since Markdown doesn\u0026rsquo;t give tools to resize fonts and styles, I was left there with hideous font.\nSections Now onto, sections, look at this. Look above this line right now. It\u0026rsquo;s a little too large wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you say? Why does it have to by like 3 times the size as the regular body of the text? I mean it\u0026rsquo;s nice that there\u0026rsquo;s a little link when you hover over it. I just wish that it would be a smidge bigger than normal body text but not as big as it is now. Maybe double the size of normal body text would do. The last post I did, I just bolded the sections just to give it a go, turned out alright tbh.\nPeople agree with me https://ericholscher.com/blog/2016/mar/15/dont-use-markdown-for-technical-docs/ https://adammichaelwood.com/talks/docs-are-engineering/ Last thoughts I mean until I can think of more stuff to criticize about Markdown, I\u0026rsquo;ll end it with this. Markdown is too weird. It needs to have more tools and make it easier to use, so we don\u0026rsquo;t combine multiple languages only for it not to work.\nThis is liluzibird, and I still have no closer.\n","date":"January 7, 2024","img":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/news/2024/01/markdown-kinda-sucks/featured.png","lang":"en","langName":"English","largeImg":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/news/2024/01/markdown-kinda-sucks/featured_hu17afcb2551516f81feaabddfe576f7ad_688471_500x0_resize_box_3.png","permalink":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/news/2024/01/markdown-kinda-sucks/","series":[],"smallImg":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/news/2024/01/markdown-kinda-sucks/featured_hu17afcb2551516f81feaabddfe576f7ad_688471_180x0_resize_box_3.png","tags":[],"timestamp":1704673957,"title":"Markdown Kinda Sucks"},{"Albert Huynh":[],"categories":[],"content":"https://www.tenor.co/view/this-is-fine-gif-5263684\nI wonder how to give credit to the creator of this gif but the guy probably stole it from some other person, who stole it from some other person, and so on. Idk, you guys can check know your meme or something. Man this markdown thing is so janky. Why is it bold? I don\u0026rsquo;t want it to be bold. How the heck do I put a caption underneath this gif?? Somebody please let me know. Account name change\nSo I changed the website and my account name to liluzibird somebody took liluzibert which was what I wanted. At least now I have a shorter name and the same name as my steam account. Hmm, I guess I would also have to redistribute the website links to anybody that cares to check my blog.\nGPG Key issues\nDuring this time of changing my name I had some issues with my GPG key. I forgot that thing is linked to my email and I use the GitHub noreply email, so that was linked to my old account name. Went through the process of regenerating a new key, connected it to my new noreply GitHub email and got more complications along the way. Eventually, I re-redid the steps and got it working. So if you look at my commit logs on GitHub, it appears as though I have been hacked or somebody has pushed malicious code to my account. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, that was all me (or was it? Suspenseful music). All the commit logs that were neither signed nor unsigned were also from me, but before I had realized that I had not properly signed my commits. Well anyway, this probably all sounds gibberish to you guys who haven\u0026rsquo;t used Git extensively but yeah, just keep in mind all the stuff I have to do to make this blog useable.\nI wonder if I should have some closer to these blog posts? I just now realized that.\n","date":"January 7, 2024","img":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/news/2024/01/name-change-and-regenerating-gpg-keys/featured.gif","lang":"en","langName":"English","largeImg":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/news/2024/01/name-change-and-regenerating-gpg-keys/featured_hu52d8b816c376955456ee00b28056ec29_1925183_500x0_resize_box_1.gif","permalink":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/news/2024/01/name-change-and-regenerating-gpg-keys/","series":[],"smallImg":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/news/2024/01/name-change-and-regenerating-gpg-keys/featured_hu52d8b816c376955456ee00b28056ec29_1925183_180x0_resize_box_1.gif","tags":[],"timestamp":1704667894,"title":"Name Change and Regenerating GPG Keys"},{"Albert Huynh":[],"categories":[],"content":"\u0026quot;Mirror Pond [Explore]\u0026quot; by mclcbooks is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nWould I be better off on a microblog site like Mastadon? This blog site is a bit more complicated than I thought. I mean some of you guys out there have probably made a website before, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit\u0026hellip;messy. Y\u0026rsquo;all think it\u0026rsquo;s easy to make all these sections? Bro, I spent the whole day figuring out how to properly make sections and nice little dropdown sidebar stuff for my docs. I mean it is kind of fun I guess, lots of control and customization. Sucks a ton of my time and nobody reads it other than me though.\nWell, since the last post I did, I\u0026rsquo;ve pretty much done what I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted. Everything I\u0026rsquo;ve done, and going to do in the future, pretty much boils down to everything being in either news or docs. For now, I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep going in this direction.

I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have done it without the help of Razon Yang, the wonderful developer of the Hugo Bootstrap theme. He has helped me out a ton with this blog site (I\u0026rsquo;ll be sure to clear the cache before I call you up). Well\u0026hellip; I already took a week to figure out more git commands (I will never fully master all these confusing instructions), reading both Hugo docs and Razon\u0026rsquo;s docs and trying to get GitHub pages to update my changes. However, I do plan on improving the website some more.\nNow, it may be surprising to some of you guys out there, but I actually have friends. Some of these friends might even go on this website and read these words as we speak. These friends, I message them quite often and frankly, I think they are getting annoyed of me sending them messages so damn often. With the creation of this blog site, I plan on bothering them even more. Send them more memes from Lemmy and posts about how Big Tech is coming after you and everybody is stealing your information, how you should convert to FOSS and use Linux instead.\nFuture plans Even though I\u0026rsquo;ve slaved many days on just getting this site up and running, I still plan on adding more features to it.\nGiscus widget for comments Uploading my documentations for projects I\u0026rsquo;ve done Make some categories for personal life, gaming, school, rant, and whatnot Whatever the heck pops into my mind Stay tuned for more updates\u0026hellip;\n","date":"January 3, 2024","img":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/news/2024/01/first-post/featured-sample.webp","lang":"en","langName":"English","largeImg":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/news/2024/01/first-post/featured-sample_huc6bcc14d597e300fd9ab4aae536c68a5_498412_500x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp","permalink":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/news/2024/01/first-post/","series":[],"smallImg":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/news/2024/01/first-post/featured-sample_huc6bcc14d597e300fd9ab4aae536c68a5_498412_180x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp","tags":[],"timestamp":1704329423,"title":"First Post"},{"Albert Huynh":[],"categories":[],"content":"Docs for whatever I\u0026rsquo;m doing.\n","date":"September 6, 2022","img":"","lang":"en","langName":"English","largeImg":"","permalink":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/docs/introduction/","series":[{"title":"Docs","url":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/series/docs/"}],"smallImg":"","tags":[],"timestamp":1662475343,"title":"Introduction"},{"Albert Huynh":[],"categories":[],"content":"See also README.md.\n","date":"April 17, 2022","img":"","lang":"en","langName":"English","largeImg":"","permalink":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/blog/2022/04/readme/","series":[],"smallImg":"","tags":[{"title":"README","url":"/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/tags/readme/"}],"timestamp":1650184529,"title":"README"},{"Albert Huynh":[],"categories":[],"content":" Privacy This page does not use any telemetry.
