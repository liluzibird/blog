For some reason my download speeds were hovering around 1mbps to 10 mbps. First, I thought it was my VPN, I&amp;rsquo;ve connected to various regions, and it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t fix my issue. Second, I tested my DNS server, as that might cause issues, so I restarted my server, still, no dice. So then I checked if there was something wrong with the provider, I went to another computer that was hardwired into the router and it was getting the normal 400 mbps speeds, so that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the issue.</description><enclosure url="https://blog/docs/linux/gaming/bluetooth-controller-slowing-downloads/featured.png" length="140385" type="image/png"/></item></channel></rss>
