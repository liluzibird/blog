For some reason my download speeds were hovering around 1mbps to 10 mbps. First, I thought it was my VPN, I&amp;rsquo;ve connected to various regions, and it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t fix my issue. Second, I tested my DNS server, as that might cause issues, so I restarted my server, still, no dice. So then I checked if there was something wrong with the provider, I went to another computer that was hardwired into the router and it was getting the normal 400 mbps speeds, so that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the issue.</description><enclosure url="https://projects.razonyang.com/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/docs/linux/gaming/bluetooth-controller-slowing-downloads/featured.png" length="140385" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Why Are People Buying Consoles?</title><link>https://projects.razonyang.com/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/blog/2024/01/why-are-people-buying-consoles/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 14:25:39 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://projects.razonyang.com/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/blog/2024/01/why-are-people-buying-consoles/</guid><description>Credits to SGRAFO

It seemed to me that I was the only kid who didn&amp;rsquo;t have an Xbox or a PlayStation. I only had access to a cheap PC my parents bought from Costco. So growing up, I pretty much only played BTD5 on Ninja Kiwi.</description><enclosure url="https://projects.razonyang.com/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton/blog/2024/01/why-are-people-buying-consoles/featured.png" length="1881174" type="image/png"/></item></channel></rss>
