For some reason my download speeds were hovering around 1mbps to 10 mbps. First, I thought it was my VPN, I&amp;rsquo;ve connected to various regions, and it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t fix my issue. Second, I tested my DNS server, as that might cause issues, so I restarted my server, still, no dice. So then I checked if there was something wrong with the provider, I went to another computer that was hardwired into the router and it was getting the normal 400 mbps speeds, so that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the issue.</description><enclosure url="https://blog/docs/linux/gaming/bluetooth-controller-slowing-downloads/featured.png" length="140385" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Why Are People Buying Consoles?</title><link>https://blog/blog/2024/01/why-are-people-buying-consoles/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 14:25:39 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog/blog/2024/01/why-are-people-buying-consoles/</guid><description>Credits to SGRAFO
My Computing Journey So ever since I was a young child, in elementary, intermediate, high school, until now, in college, I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt left out. It seemed to me that I was the only kid who didn&amp;rsquo;t have an Xbox or a PlayStation. I only had access to a cheap PC my parents bought from Costco. So growing up, I pretty much only played BTD5 on Ninja Kiwi.</description><enclosure url="https://blog/blog/2024/01/why-are-people-buying-consoles/featured.png" length="1881174" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Team Fortress 2</title><link>https://blog/docs/linux/gaming/tf2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 18:23:25 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog/docs/linux/gaming/tf2/</guid><description>Stolen from https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/
Pretty OG game if I do say myself. Still can&amp;rsquo;t access the chat for some reason, I think somebody said online that I gotta buy something from the store, so I might do that.
Anyway, first you have to install lib32-gperftools
Run this line in launch options:
LD_PRELOAD=$LD_PRELOAD:/usr/lib32/libtcmalloc_minimal.so %command% -secure</description><enclosure url="https://blog/docs/linux/gaming/tf2/featured.png" length="372558" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Apex Legends</title><link>https://blog/docs/linux/gaming/apex-legends/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 16:59:46 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog/docs/linux/gaming/apex-legends/</guid><description>Image stolen from https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172470/Apex_Legends/
So over my winter break I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a little gaming here and there. One day, my friends invited me to play Apex Legends. So I decided to hop check out protondb and give it a try. Much to my luck Apex Legends actually works (with a few tweaks).
Pretty much, all you have to do is run this line through the Steam launcher&amp;rsquo;s launch options:</description><enclosure url="https://blog/docs/linux/gaming/apex-legends/featured.png" length="486996" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Superflight</title><link>https://blog/docs/linux/gaming/superflight/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 16:59:46 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog/docs/linux/gaming/superflight/</guid><description>Image stolen from https://store.steampowered.com/app/732430/Superflight/
Cool game introduced to me by my friend Nate. The game lags a bit but is overall pretty playable on Linux.
Run this launch option:
PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 %command%</description><enclosure url="https://blog/docs/linux/gaming/superflight/featured.png" length="222692" type="image/png"/></item></channel></rss>
