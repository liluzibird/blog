So I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many of you follow the progress on my github, but essentially, I&amp;rsquo;ve been moving back and forth since I got this new domain (liluzibird.dev). Originally I had my blog site at my repo /liluzibird.github.io, then, I got my blog so I renamed /liluzibird.github.io to /old-blog-site and cloned it to have the new site at /blog. Now that I have my portfolio website at /liluzibird.</description><enclosure url="https://blog/blog/2024/05/swapping-reposagain/featured.png" length="762793" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Blog Site Redirect</title><link>https://blog/docs/blog/blog-site-redirect/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Apr 2024 16:36:28 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://blog/docs/blog/blog-site-redirect/</guid><description>Picture from digitalmarketing.com
So over the course of this week, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do my math homework, so I bought a domain and started moving my blog and changing my portfolio website over. It has been a tough journey and I there have been many hiccups along the way, probably messed up the few people who read my site but, it all worked out in the end.
One of the main struggles of the migration was figuring out how I wanted to have my website structured.</description><enclosure url="https://blog/docs/blog/blog-site-redirect/featured.png" length="48244" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Why Are People Buying Consoles?</title><link>https://blog/blog/2024/01/why-are-people-buying-consoles/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 14:25:39 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog/blog/2024/01/why-are-people-buying-consoles/</guid><description>Credits to SGRAFO
My Computing Journey So ever since I was a young child, in elementary, intermediate, high school, until now, in college, I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt left out. It seemed to me that I was the only kid who didn&amp;rsquo;t have an Xbox or a PlayStation. I only had access to a cheap PC my parents bought from Costco. So growing up, I pretty much only played BTD5 on Ninja Kiwi.</description><enclosure url="https://blog/blog/2024/01/why-are-people-buying-consoles/featured.png" length="1881174" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Mfa and Why Our Most Sensitive Stuff Is the Least Secure</title><link>https://blog/blog/2024/01/mfa-and-why-our-most-sensitive-stuff-is-the-least-secure/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 21:17:26 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog/blog/2024/01/mfa-and-why-our-most-sensitive-stuff-is-the-least-secure/</guid><description>Image stolen from https://cyberintro.net/what-is-sim-swapping-and-how-it-works/
Gaming Services Are More Secure Than Financial Institutions I recently realized the terrible insecure state of our online accounts. Whenever somebody brings up something about bank security, I always have to bring up that my gaming accounts are actually probably safer than my life&amp;rsquo;s savings. Steam, Itch, and Epic Games are all gaming accounts that I use frequently. What do they have in common? They all use 2FA.</description><enclosure url="https://blog/blog/2024/01/mfa-and-why-our-most-sensitive-stuff-is-the-least-secure/featured.png" length="192672" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>I Broke My Computer...twice</title><link>https://blog/blog/2024/01/i-broke-my-computer...twice/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2024 17:01:43 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog/blog/2024/01/i-broke-my-computer...twice/</guid><description>_image from IT Crowd S1E5
I already messaged this to my friend already, so to keep myself from coming up with a new way to reformat those words, I&amp;rsquo;ll just paste what I messaged them here.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have this blog listed on my resume or anything, so I feel like it would be kind of safe to curse on here. Albeit, if an employer is going through every repo and sees this they might be a little put off.</description><enclosure url="https://blog/blog/2024/01/i-broke-my-computer...twice/featured.jpg" length="15156" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>First Blog</title><link>https://blog/blog/2024/01/first-blog/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2024 16:42:42 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog/blog/2024/01/first-blog/</guid><description>&amp;quot;[Torc waterfall, co.

I want to be able to visit my website under the /blog subdirectory and find some stuff here. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to separate things; /docs for documentation and guides; leaving /blog for everything else, mostly me typing out what pops into my head and whatever I find interesting.</description><enclosure url="https://blog/blog/2024/01/first-blog/featured.jpg" length="388740" type="image/jpeg"/></item></channel></rss>
