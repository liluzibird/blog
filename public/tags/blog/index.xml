Steam, Itch, and Epic Games are all gaming accounts that I use frequently. What do they have in common? They all use 2FA.]]></description><enclosure url="http://localhost:40219/blog/2024/01/mfa-and-why-our-most-sensitive-stuff-is-the-least-secure/featured.png" length="192672" type="image/png" />

I want to be able to visit my website under the /blog subdirectory and find some stuff here. So I&rsquo;m going to try to separate things; /docs for documentation and guides; leaving /blog for everything else, mostly me typing out what pops into my head and whatever I find interesting.]]></description><enclosure url="http://localhost:40219/blog/2024/01/first-blog/featured.jpg" length="388740" type="image/jpeg" />
