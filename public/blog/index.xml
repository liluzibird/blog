      <description><![CDATA[LFG boys, I successfully did it. Could&rsquo;ve gone a bit smoother but the result is as desired. Solid day of procrastinating from my classes if I do say so myself. Over the coming weeks, I&rsquo;ll probably upload my backlog of content that I&rsquo;ve written down ideas for.
See you guys later.]]></description><enclosure url="http://localhost:40219/blog/2024/04/successful-migration/featured.png" length="137302" type="image/png" />

      <description><![CDATA[Linus Torvalds Being Based
How Do I Remove Sensitive Information Online? I made a post on Lemmy recently and received a lot of negative feedback for requesting on advice on how to remove my information or just straight up not use my physical home address and instead maybe a PO box. After all the feedback I got, I decided that this wouldn&rsquo;t be possible. Also, it might not even be the bank that leaked my information but my government.]]></description><enclosure url="http://localhost:40219/blog/2024/02/how-to-erase-your-information-online/featured.png" length="325211" type="image/png" />

My Computing Journey So ever since I was a young child, in elementary, intermediate, high school, until now, in college, I&rsquo;ve always felt left out. It seemed to me that I was the only kid who didn&rsquo;t have an Xbox or a PlayStation. I only had access to a cheap PC my parents bought from Costco. So growing up, I pretty much only played BTD5 on Ninja Kiwi.]]></description><enclosure url="http://localhost:40219/blog/2024/01/why-are-people-buying-consoles/featured.png" length="1881174" type="image/png" />

Gaming Services Are More Secure Than Financial Institutions I recently realized the terrible insecure state of our online accounts. Whenever somebody brings up something about bank security, I always have to bring up that my gaming accounts are actually probably safer than my life&rsquo;s savings. Steam, Itch, and Epic Games are all gaming accounts that I use frequently. What do they have in common? They all use 2FA.]]></description><enclosure url="http://localhost:40219/blog/2024/01/mfa-and-why-our-most-sensitive-stuff-is-the-least-secure/featured.png" length="192672" type="image/png" />

      <description><![CDATA[So I use arch (btw), and I recently had to do a few reinstalls (wrote about in my last blog). This last fuck up was because I was trying to install some big files, but I partitioned it wrong. I trusted the archinstall script to basically do everything for me, and it separated the home partition. When it did that, there wasn&rsquo;t enough space in usr/share for it to download anymore packages.]]></description><enclosure url="http://localhost:40219/blog/2024/01/do-you-really-need-a-/home-partition/featured.gif" length="3082050" type="image/gif" />

I already messaged this to my friend already, so to keep myself from coming up with a new way to reformat those words, I&rsquo;ll just paste what I messaged them here.
I don&rsquo;t have this blog listed on my resume or anything, so I feel like it would be kind of safe to curse on here. Albeit, if an employer is going through every repo and sees this they might be a little put off.]]></description><enclosure url="http://localhost:40219/blog/2024/01/i-broke-my-computer...twice/featured.jpg" length="15156" type="image/jpeg" />

I want to be able to visit my website under the /blog subdirectory and find some stuff here. So I&rsquo;m going to try to separate things; /docs for documentation and guides; leaving /blog for everything else, mostly me typing out what pops into my head and whatever I find interesting.]]></description><enclosure url="http://localhost:40219/blog/2024/01/first-blog/featured.jpg" length="388740" type="image/jpeg" />
