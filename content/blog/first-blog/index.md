I want to be able to visit my website under the /blog subdirectory and find some stuff here. So I'm going to try to separate things; /docs for documentation and guides; leaving /blog for everything else, mostly me typing out what pops into my head and whatever I find interesting. I think news might be for website only updates. I might transfer the current articles in the /news directory to /blog, but I got to make sure that doesn't break things like formatting and the comments.
