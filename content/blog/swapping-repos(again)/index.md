I know, I know guys, I'm sorry. So I don't know how many of you follow the progress on my github, but essentially, I've been moving back and forth since I got this new domain ([liluzibird.dev](https://liluzibird.dev)). Originally I had my blog site at my repo /liluzibird.github.io, then, I got my blog so I renamed /liluzibird.github.io to /old-blog-site and cloned it to have the new site at /blog. Now that I have my portfolio website at /liluzibird.github.io, I thought to myself, there are a bunch of comments that are missing because I cloned it and so the comments are located at the other repo, so I'm going back to the /old-blog-site and renaming it to /blog.

Basically, I'm reverting my changes, however, if all you care about is accessing the site, just go to [blog.liluzibird.dev](https://blog.liluzibird.dev) and it should pretty much all be there and you kinda don't really need to follow all this.

I'm just inching my way through this troubleshooting, alright? Bear with me.
