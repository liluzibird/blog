*https://www.tenor.co/view/this-is-fine-gif-5263684*

I wonder how to give credit to the creator of this gif but the guy probably stole it from some other person, who stole it from some other person, and so on. Idk, you guys can check [know your meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-is-fine) or something. Man this markdown thing is so janky. Why is it bold? I don't want it to be bold. How the heck do I put a caption underneath this gif?? Somebody please let me know.

**Account name change**

So I changed the website and my account name to [liluzibird](https://github.com/liluzibird) somebody took [liluzibert](https://github.com/liluzibert) which was what I wanted. At least now I have a shorter name and the same name as my [steam account](https://steamcommunity.com/id/liluzibird/). Hmm, I guess I would also have to redistribute the website links to anybody that cares to check my blog.

**GPG Key issues**

During this time of changing my name I had some issues with my GPG key. I forgot that thing is linked to my email and I use the [GitHub noreply email](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address), so that was linked to my old account name. Went through the process of regenerating a new key, connected it to my new noreply GitHub email and got more complications along the way. Eventually, I re-redid the steps and got it working. So if you look at my commit logs on GitHub, it appears as though I have been hacked or somebody has pushed malicious code to my account. Don't worry, that was all me (or was it? *Suspenseful music*). All the commit logs that were neither signed nor unsigned were also from me, but before I had realized that I had not properly signed my commits. Well anyway, this probably all sounds gibberish to you guys who haven't used Git extensively but yeah, just keep in mind all the stuff I have to do to make this blog useable.


I wonder if I should have some closer to these blog posts? I just now realized that.
