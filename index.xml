So I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many of you follow the progress on my github, but essentially, I&amp;rsquo;ve been moving back and forth since I got this new domain (liluzibird.dev). Originally I had my blog site at my repo /liluzibird.github.io, then, I got my blog so I renamed /liluzibird.github.io to /old-blog-site and cloned it to have the new site at /blog. Now that I have my portfolio website at /liluzibird.</description><enclosure url="https://blog/blog/2024/05/swapping-reposagain/featured.png" length="762793" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Blog Site Redirect</title><link>https://blog/docs/blog/blog-site-redirect/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Apr 2024 16:36:28 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://blog/docs/blog/blog-site-redirect/</guid><description>Picture from digitalmarketing.com
So over the course of this week, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do my math homework, so I bought a domain and started moving my blog and changing my portfolio website over. It has been a tough journey and I there have been many hiccups along the way, probably messed up the few people who read my site but, it all worked out in the end.
One of the main struggles of the migration was figuring out how I wanted to have my website structured.</description><enclosure url="https://blog/docs/blog/blog-site-redirect/featured.png" length="48244" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Successful Migration!</title><link>https://blog/blog/2024/04/successful-migration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 00:28:25 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://blog/blog/2024/04/successful-migration/</guid><description>LFG boys, I successfully did it. Could&amp;rsquo;ve gone a bit smoother but the result is as desired. Solid day of procrastinating from my classes if I do say so myself. Over the coming weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably upload my backlog of content that I&amp;rsquo;ve written down ideas for.
See you guys later.</description><enclosure url="https://blog/blog/2024/04/successful-migration/featured.gif" length="232246" type="image/gif"/></item><item><title>LAST POST!

How could I do this without consulting the home networking subreddit. Though, those people said I would need to spend like $400 or something buying ubiquiti unifi WAP, build a small pc for the router, build a pc for a firewall, etc. The task is daunting and even though I would love to do all of that.</description><enclosure url="https://blog/docs/networking/openwrt/i-bought-a-new-router/featured.png" length="220370" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>How to Erase Your Information Online</title><link>https://blog/blog/2024/02/how-to-erase-your-information-online/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 13:17:33 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog/blog/2024/02/how-to-erase-your-information-online/</guid><description>Linus Torvalds Being Based
How Do I Remove Sensitive Information Online? I made a post on Lemmy recently and received a lot of negative feedback for requesting on advice on how to remove my information or just straight up not use my physical home address and instead maybe a PO box. After all the feedback I got, I decided that this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible.

I wasn&amp;rsquo;t busy that day and fortunately, none of the users were online so that gave me more time in case something goes wrong. The network was back up and running but during that time frame, I was freaking out so much.
Docker Name Changes As I was rebooting the server and attempted to access my Docker containers, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find Docker located anywhere in my files.</description><enclosure url="https://blog/docs/networking/docker/docker-name-change/featured.png" length="35411" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Updating to DSM 7.2.1</title><link>https://blog/docs/synology/updating-to-dsm-7.2.1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 17:05:32 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog/docs/synology/updating-to-dsm-7.2.1/</guid><description>Preface So as stated in my last post about the Docker name change, that issue arose from me updating my server to DSM 7.2. Would you believe it if I told you that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only issue that I encountered? Along with that whole Docker name change, Synology Drive also messed up, and that included its dependencies like Synology Photos. I had to fix that ASAP as I had many users using those services.</description><enclosure url="https://blog/docs/synology/updating-to-dsm-7.2.1/featured.png" length="7591565" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Bluetooth Controller Slowing Downloads</title><link>https://blog/docs/linux/gaming/bluetooth-controller-slowing-downloads/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 16:17:57 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog/docs/linux/gaming/bluetooth-controller-slowing-downloads/</guid><description>Over the weekend, I was doing some gaming on my laptop with some newly purchased bluetooth controllers I just purchased. For some reason my download speeds were hovering around 1mbps to 10 mbps. First, I thought it was my VPN, I&amp;rsquo;ve connected to various regions, and it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t fix my issue. Second, I tested my DNS server, as that might cause issues, so I restarted my server, still, no dice. So then I checked if there was something wrong with the provider, I went to another computer that was hardwired into the router and it was getting the normal 400 mbps speeds, so that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the issue.</description><enclosure url="https://blog/docs/linux/gaming/bluetooth-controller-slowing-downloads/featured.png" length="140385" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Why Are People Buying Consoles?</title><link>https://blog/blog/2024/01/why-are-people-buying-consoles/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 14:25:39 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog/blog/2024/01/why-are-people-buying-consoles/</guid><description>Credits to SGRAFO
My Computing Journey So ever since I was a young child, in elementary, intermediate, high school, until now, in college, I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt left out. It seemed to me that I was the only kid who didn&amp;rsquo;t have an Xbox or a PlayStation. I only had access to a cheap PC my parents bought from Costco. So growing up, I pretty much only played BTD5 on Ninja Kiwi.</description><enclosure url="https://blog/blog/2024/01/why-are-people-buying-consoles/featured.png" length="1881174" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Mfa and Why Our Most Sensitive Stuff Is the Least Secure</title><link>https://blog/blog/2024/01/mfa-and-why-our-most-sensitive-stuff-is-the-least-secure/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 21:17:26 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog/blog/2024/01/mfa-and-why-our-most-sensitive-stuff-is-the-least-secure/</guid><description>Image stolen from https://cyberintro.net/what-is-sim-swapping-and-how-it-works/
Gaming Services Are More Secure Than Financial Institutions I recently realized the terrible insecure state of our online accounts. Whenever somebody brings up something about bank security, I always have to bring up that my gaming accounts are actually probably safer than my life&amp;rsquo;s savings. Steam, Itch, and Epic Games are all gaming accounts that I use frequently. What do they have in common? They all use 2FA.</description><enclosure url="https://blog/blog/2024/01/mfa-and-why-our-most-sensitive-stuff-is-the-least-secure/featured.png" length="192672" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Do You Really Need a /Home Partition?</title><link>https://blog/blog/2024/01/do-you-really-need-a-/home-partition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 14:02:37 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog/blog/2024/01/do-you-really-need-a-/home-partition/</guid><description>So I use arch (btw), and I recently had to do a few reinstalls (wrote about in my last blog).

I already messaged this to my friend already, so to keep myself from coming up with a new way to reformat those words, I&amp;rsquo;ll just paste what I messaged them here.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have this blog listed on my resume or anything, so I feel like it would be kind of safe to curse on here.

For some reason turning on your monitors in Linux is a bit funky, so you might need to type a few commands in the terminal for monitors to power off. I believe this method only works on x11.
To Turn Off:
xset -display :0.0 dpms force off
To Turn On:
xset -display :0.0 dpms force on
If your display turns off and then immediately back on then try the following which adds a delay of 1 second before turning the screen off.</description><enclosure url="https://blog/docs/linux/misc/linux-x11-monitors-off/featured.png" length="9860" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Team Fortress 2</title><link>https://blog/docs/linux/gaming/tf2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 18:23:25 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog/docs/linux/gaming/tf2/</guid><description>Stolen from https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/
Pretty OG game if I do say myself. Still can&amp;rsquo;t access the chat for some reason, I think somebody said online that I gotta buy something from the store, so I might do that.
Anyway, first you have to install lib32-gperftools

So over my winter break I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a little gaming here and there. One day, my friends invited me to play Apex Legends. So I decided to hop check out protondb and give it a try. Much to my luck Apex Legends actually works (with a few tweaks).
Pretty much, all you have to do is run this line through the Steam launcher&amp;rsquo;s launch options:</description><enclosure url="https://blog/docs/linux/gaming/apex-legends/featured.png" length="486996" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Superflight</title><link>https://blog/docs/linux/gaming/superflight/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 16:59:46 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog/docs/linux/gaming/superflight/</guid><description>Image stolen from https://store.steampowered.com/app/732430/Superflight/
